 These are notes that I made as I did the course in Learning How To Learn, a course hosted on coursera and given by Barbara Oakley.
## Focused and diffuse mode
 
The focused mode is a mode of attention where we intentionally direct all our working memory and cognitive power on a single problem.
 
Diffuse mode is when we relax our attention and let our mind move easily between different ideas. This can include drifting to other topics. Great examples include being in the shower, in the bath, or exercising.
 
These two modes can be thought of in the way a pinball moves around a machine. When the pins on the machine are very close together it stays in a small area. When the pins are farther apart the ball can bounce all over the machine. This allows novel connections to be made.
 
Both modes are important for learning, and we need to be able to swap between them to solve problems and generate new ideas by combining ideas together.
 
Dreams can be an amazing place for distant neural connections to spark. But for dreams to help with problem solving you need to have wrestled with the problem consciously and have the information in your mind during the day.
 
Some famous inventors and artists have used techniques where they approached the very brink of sleep, only to rouse themselves at the last moment and go to write down any interesting ideas they may have had.
 
The pomodoro technique is a great way to engage bouts of focused mode thinking. For maximum benefit, remove distractions such as phones, noisy people, or alerts from your computer.
 
Your neural connections or patterns get stronger with repeated exercise. To build strong neural connections you need to practice them each day over a longer period. You can't build a sturdy structure in a day. Sleep is actually the firming agent that helps to consolidate the memories from the day.
## Intro to memory
 
analogy is a useful tool for learning as it makes things more memorable.
 
Long term memory can be compared to a storehouse where you can store an incredible amount of data but where that data is difficult or slow to access. Often we don't actually forget information, but simply lose the ability to access it. This is why shower thoughts can be so interesting, because for brief moments we get access to things normally beyond our reach.
 
Working memory acts as a blackboard where things are easy to access but can quickly be erased. We can generally only hold about 4 to 6 things in our working memory. This seems to expand in the minds of experts, but that is largely because they will have chunked the information. You can think of it as being more compact and able to fit in another slot of working memory.
 
## Interview with Terence
 
There is no such thing as multi-tasking but you can get quite good at context switching. Though in general context-switching is going to hurt your productivity.
 
The moment when you're about to context switch can often be a big moment for procrastination. In those times you have to be especially vigilant.
 
A rich environment of people and activities helps to improve neuron generation in the brain. Exercise also helps with this, especially vigorous exercise.
 
Being in a creative environment helps to make you more creative.
 
Don't get hung up on test questions that you can't answer when doing examinations. Skip to the ones you can easily handle first.
 
Success isn't about being smart. It's largely about passion and persistence.
 
## Language learning tips with Benny Lewis
 
It is critical to take breaks when you're learning. Both at the large scale and the small scale.
 
If a certain learning strategy isn't working for you after a decent length of time, you need to change your strategy.
 
Use mnemonics. For example, tish for table in German. tissues -> tish etc.
 
## Creativity and problem solving
 
Solving problems is a creative process.
 
Leadership is the ability to disguise panic.
 
Discomfort is the sign of change occurring.
 
OCEAN abbreviation for characteristics:
 
* Openness -> correlated with creativity
* conscientiousness
* extraversion
* agreeableness -> negatively correlated with creativity.
* neuroticism
 
This means that being less agreeable is an important aspect of creative people. Probably because you need to disagree in order to think in an original way.
 
One must balance novelty with usefulness to others. For example you might have an amazingly creative idea for a product, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't serve anybody.
 
It helps a lot, when dealing with a problem, to zoom in and out to get a different perspective. This can be thought of as thinking of the problem in its broader context, and thinking of the tiniest details of its implementation.
## Chunking
Understanding is like a glue that helps you connect the information required to make chunks.
 
It's important to review information even if you feel you understood it well at that moment. Often the reviewing is where you really make it stick.
 
The only way to achieve true mastery of a subject is to do it yourself.
 
You need both a top down learning approach to get context of the topic.
 
And you need a bottom up approach in order to develop chunks of the subject.
 
Both are necessary. Context for knowing when to apply a chunk, and bottom up to build the chunks.
 
It can be a mistake to obsess over trying to fully understand a concept before moving on. Often you need to move on and allow that concept to sink in later once you have more context.
 
## Illusions of competence
Recall can be a great way to test your understanding. Look away for a few seconds and see if you can recall the material and the most important points.
 
Students who used recall as their primary learning strategy outperformed learners using any other strategy. This means recall is probably the most effective way to study.
 
Read -> recall -> read -> recall. This is the ideal studying pattern.
 
Recall doesn't just help you remember the material, you also gain a deeper understanding of it when you bring it up in your mind.
 
Looking at the material and thinking that you understand it can be an illusion of competence. This illusion can be dispelled by seeing if you can recall it and understand when not looking at it.
 
Having the book open or googling something and then feeling like you understand it can be one of the greatest illusions of competence. As a programmer this is something to be particularly wary of.
 
Try to practice recall in many different physical locations. This will give you greater flexibility in your ability to recall the information. Generalise your learning.
## What motivates you?
Brain chemicals to know about:
 
Acetocholyne -> released when focusing
 
dopamine -> released when receiving an unexpected reward.
 
serotonin -> Induces a feeling of satisfaction and goodness. In primate communities, alpha males tend to have the most serotonin, while lower ranked primates tend to have less.
 
## The value of a chunk library
Your expertise in a subject is strongly correlated with the number of chunks you have in that subject. These chunks can be drawn upon to help you solve problems.
 
Your diffuse mode of thinking can help you to connect chunks together.
 
You'll be able to solve problems faster as new patterns form in your network of chunks.
 
When your intuition comes to you with an answer to a problem, you should still be careful and might need to check it for accuracy if it's a delicate problem.
 
Having a large library of chunks is also useful when learning new subjects because often a chunk will be applicable in a new domain. This is called transfer.
## Einstellung and Interleaving
Einstellung means 'mindset' in German. In learning it refers to a repeated mental pattern which can often be a hindrance to learning or problem solving.
 
Be careful if you find yourself trying to solve a problem using the same strategy over and over.
 
<img-cont src="a_000232_large.jpg" alt="vehicle in a rut"> </img-cont>
 
Interleaving is when you try and generalise your understanding of a chunk by varying the context or altering the parameters of the problem. For example, doing a harder set of examples of the problem. This helps to improve flexibility.
 
Book: The Structure of a Scientific Revolution New people, either young or from different fields, are normally responsible for the greatest shifts in a field. This is because they transfer their chunks from other contexts.
 
Interleaving can counter einstellung by generating novel approaches in your problem solving. This is because it can help you to find new ways to apply chunked information to the problem at hand.
## Summing up
Recall can work as a way of building strong neural hooks for your knowledge.
 
You can practice Interleaving by working with different chunks, approaches and techniques all in one session.
 
Chunks are best built with:
* understanding.
* Focused attention.
* Practice.
 
Recall is an effective way of testing your knowledge and understanding of something.
 
Mini testing is an effective way to dispel Illusions of competence.
 
Developing a chunk does not by itself give you flexibility in applying that chunk.
 
Making mistakes is something to be welcomed when you learn.
 
Deliberately practice the difficult stuff. Otherwise you might fall into an illusion of competence.
 
Use the 30 second review. This technique is a great way to cement the valuable information in your day to day life. It can be practiced by taking 30 seconds after a learning session or important experience and trying to gather up the most important things that came up. Ideally you write these down.
 
Chunking requires focused attention and understanding. To build expertise you need flexibility to apply your chunks in an unusual way.
 
Recall is the best way to consolidate your knowledge.
 
## Interview with Dr Fortenberry
 
<img-cont src="Fortenberry-alt-2-edited-300x224.jpg"  alt="Dr Fortenberry"/> </img-cont>
 
Working alone is deadly. You need to do your learning as a member of some kind of community.
 
Engineering is a team sport. Your team members also need to be serious about studying and learning.
 
Build a community. Give support to your community members.
 
When you take breaks from your learning, make sure you actually relax your brain.  Don't do stressful activities in your breaks.
 
Use as many modes of input as possible in your learning. Use sounds, visuals, vivid concepts, gamify it, explain it to others. When you convert a concept into a different form, you build new connections in your brain that help make it sick.
 
## Interview with Scott Young
<img-cont src="Z58FB04s_400x400.png" alt="Scott Young" /> </img-cont>
 
Scott Young took on and completed the learning challenge of learning the 4 year undergrad computer science course at MIT in 1 year of independent learning.
 
Always do a problem yourself before looking at the solution. Only look at the solution if you've really done your best already.
 
When reviewing a problem, write down how you solved it. See where the fuzzy areas are in your recall. Those are your weak spots.
 
Try to turn your learning into specific projects. For example: learning everything about this subject in 1 month. Make it time bound.
 
When you don't study with intensity you end up taking longer to learn a subject. Your learning sessions should be like short, intense sprints.
 
To remember something, ask "When and how will I use this?"
 
Apply directness. When you want to learn something, approach it as directly as possible. If you want to get better at coding, code more. If you want to get conversational with a new language, then find a native speaker and only speak the new language.
 
Read Ultralearning to learn more.
## Procrastination and memory
Good learning is a piece by piece activity. It should span a decent period of time.
 
Using willpower is expensive. You shouldn't have to use it to fight procrastination. Find ways to dodge the moments of procrastination or to remove the temptation completely.
 
The discomfort or pain of starting something new, normally only lasts 8 seconds or so.
 
We procrastinate to relieve pain or discomfort from doing certain activities. Boredom is uncomfortable, and if you observe carefully you can feel the uncomfortable sensations in your body when working.
 
Your habits consist of 4 parts:
 
* The cue, which is whatever triggers the habit.
* The routine. This is the zombie mode where your brain falls into a state of lower energy usage and follows a familiar pattern.
* The reward. This is a certain sensation you get to indicate the end of the habit cycle.For example: the feeling of clean teeth after brushing.
* The underlying belief. This is the belief that drives the habit.
 
## To avoid procrastination
Avoid focusing on product or outcomes. Instead, focus on the process to get to the outcome. For example, instead of focusing on finishing an essay, focus on doing a 30 minute pomodoro session on the essay.
 
Cultivate that process as a habit. Make that process into the lever that you pull when you want to get something done.
 
When you find yourself procrastinating, simply carefully observe the sensations in your body. Often the procrastinating activity will involve something that creates pleasant sensations. Observe them.
 
## Harnessing your zombies
Analyse your habits based on their 4 parts.
 
### Part 1: The cue
Each of these can be a potential cue for habit execution.
* Location -> At your desk.
* Time -> First thing in the morning.
* Feeling -> Tired, angry, or stressed.
* Reaction to stimulus -> Seeing a certain image, song or person.
 
All of these stimulate certain sensations on the body. These sensations are what lead to a reaction, which is the beginning of the routine part of the habit.
 
### The routine
The routine is where stuff happens. Often this part of a habit can be changed, while keeping the other parts. For example some smokers quit by doing a run when they feel that urge to smoke.
 
Plan what you'll do instead to get the kind of results you want.
 
### The reward
Reward yourself for the completion of a positive routine. This helps to cement the habit in place.
 
### The belief
A great way to shift your underlying beliefs that keep you doing a certain habit can be hanging around people who have different beliefs.
 
We might be inspired because of the results they get, or we might want to fit in, or it might just provide good company. The result is that our beliefs shift, and so do our habits.
 
It's also easy to fall back into old habits during times of stress. During these times it is best to try and speak to people with the beliefs and habits we want, or change our context to make those undesirable habits more difficult to do.
 
## Planning
Have a weekly list of key tasks to accomplish. These can be social, admin, personal or work related.
 
Prepare a list of tasks to get done each night for the next day. This helps your zombie mode get started on the tasks easily the next day.
 
Try to keep the daily task list short, only 4 to 6 items.
 
Plan the time at which you quit. Quitting your planning time is at least as important as planning your working time.
 
Plan when you'll take breaks, and be sure to include some movement/exercise.
 
Put the hardest stuff at the beginning of your day. (Eat your frogs).
 
## Summing up procrastination
Keep a proper journal to see what does and doesn't work.
 
Delay rewards until your work is complete.
 
Trust your plan.
 
Write your tasks for the next day the day before.
 
Eat your frogs first.
 
Analyse your habits and see how to change them.
## Memory and mind palaces
Our visual and spatial abilities are highly developed compared to our brain's other abilities.
 
We can take advantage of this when we remember stuff by tying it up with visual and spatial features. This is the power of the mind palace.
 
To remember something:
* It must be memorable.
* It must be repeated (Anki is a great tool for this)
* You have to pay attention.
 
The process of remembering stuff can be thought of as a cycle between our active working memories and our inactive long term memories.
 
Every time we re-activate some information and move it to our working memory we reconsolidate that information, and make it easier to access from our long term memory.
 
Astrocytes are a key component in brain function and learning. Here are some of their features:
 
* They provide nutrients to neurons.
* They play a role in the repair of neurons.
* Einstein had significantly more of these in his brain than normal.
 
## Meaningful groups
Create meaningful groups of information to help you remember them.
 
Vampires are repelled by Garlic, Rosemary, Hawthorne, and Mustard. GRHM -> Graham cracker.
 
<img-cont src="images.jpeg" alt="willpower from What I've Learned youtube channel" /> </img-cont>
 
Medical students use the sentence "Some lovers try positions they can't handle" to remember the first letters of all the bones in the hand.
 
Try to use this technique yourself to create novel groups.
 
A memory palace is also an effective way to remember sequences of information.
 
The memory palace involves breaking a location you know well into pieces and then associating each item on the list with each piece of the location in a vivid way.
 
Remembering things in this way helps you to achieve mastery in them faster. It also helps you to become more creative, as these require creative images of the information to make it more vivid and memorable.
 
Using these techniques does get easier over time.
 
You will also be able to use and apply the concepts you've learned more easily when you can remember them easily.
 
## Summary
To get information into long term memory you need to consolidate it over a few days.
 
When you've learned a concept well it takes up less space in working memory due to chunking.
 
Relate ideas to things that interest you. For example, when trying to remember a specific number, think of a number in a field you like already. For example 1105 might be a significant date you need to remember in history, and for a runner this might be a good time in which to run 2km(11:05), so they can link these things together to remember the date.
 
By learning things quickly and well with tools like memory palaces, you can quickly achieve mastery.
 
Create meaningful groups to simplify material.
 
## Interview with Nelson Dellis
When trying to remember a new person, take time to find something interesting about them and create that into a vivid image of them to remember them with.
 
Try to test your recall frequently.
 
How to remember complex concepts:
* Go through a body of text or other learning material.
* Identify key words or phrases.
* Turn those into images.
* Put them into a memory palace.
 
How to keep your memory sharp:
* Challenge yourself to remember things.
* Be social.
* Have fish oil. Ideally from a cold chain source.
* Be physically active.
* Be joyful.
 
## Interview with Robert Gamache
 
<img-cont src="Gamache-Robert-800-opt_tcm18-255306.jpg" alt="Robert Gamache" /> </img-cont>
 
Study every subject every day. If you spend just 15 minutes reviewing your knowledge of all of the important subjects, you'll have a wonderful ability to work with them in your daily life.
 
It's like playing an instrument. When you're in practice you can easily pick it up and play. When you let the practice decay for a long term it's much harder to play well coming back to it.
 
You can hardwire your brain to solve problems by working with novel problems every day. He did this by working through every exercise in the textbook relentlessly.
 
Taking breaks at both the macro and micro levels is critical. But you also need to be working hard.
 
Choose a career where you enjoy solving those kinds of problems.
 
Sometimes you don't love the subject immediately. In some subjects, that love will take some time.
 
When you're still getting started work with examples that make it easy for you to get started. Don't get stuck trying to solve hard stuff at first.
 
## Interview with Keith Devlin The Math Guy
His advice for when you first look at a math problem:
1. Don't panic.
2. figure out
   1. What are you trying to achieve?
   2. What are you trying to do here? Perhaps imagine the problem visually.
   3. What information do you have available?
 
Often the traditional school systems encourage speed in maths. You don't need to go fast.
 
Perhaps you can draw a diagram of the problem.
 
Can you apply a known solution to solve this problem?
 
Can you adapt a strategy to solve this problem?
 
Can you figure out a novel strategy? (This is the fun one)
 
If you've been struggling for a while, take a break.
 
You need to have tried every approach you can think of.
 
Think slowly. Slow down your problem solving. Don't rush.
 
When dealing with a massive problem for a long time Keith starts to think of the problem like a member of his family. Often thinking back to it and wondering if something he's learned might affect it or provide a solution.
 
You are busy growing the neural structures to think about this problem as you grapple with it.
 
Doing physical activity like climbing, cycling, running etc can help stimulate your thinking.
 
Multitasking isn't possible.
 
Work flat out and with intense focus for periods of time.
 
You don't need willpower all the time, just when you start doing something.
 
Whenever you switch tasks or projects, procrastination can be an issue.
 
Remove all alerts and distractions from your workspace.
