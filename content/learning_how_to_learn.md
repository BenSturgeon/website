### Focused and diffuse mode

![car stuck in a rut.](img)

[[Focused mode]] is a mode of [[attention]] where we [[intentionally]] direct all our [[working memory]] and [[cognitive power]] on a single [[problem]]. This involves a [[deliberate practice ]]of holding certain parts of the problem in mind. 

[[Diffuse mode]] is when we relax our [[attention]] and let our mind move easily between different ideas. 

These two modes can be thought of as the way a pinball moves around a machine. When the pins on the machine are very close together it stays in a small area.

When the pins are further apart the ball can bounce all over the machine. This means that [[novel connections]] can be made.

Both are important for [[learning]], and we need to be able to swap between them to [[solve problems]] and have [[new ideas]].

[[Dreams]] can be an amazing place for distant [[neural connections]] to spark. But for dreams to work you need to have wrestled with the [[problem]] consciously and have the [[information]] in your [[mind]] during the day.

[[Practice]] makes permanent

Remove all [[distractions]] when in a focused [[pomodoro]] session


Your [[neural connections]] or patterns get stronger with [[repeated exercise]]

To build strong [[neural connections]] you need to [[Practice]] them each day over a [[longer period]].

#### Intro to memory

[[analogy]] is a useful tool for learning as it makes things more [[memorable]].

[[long term memory]] can be compared to a storehouse where you can store an incredible amount of [[data]] but where that [[data]] is difficult or slow to access.

[[working memory]] acts as a blackboard where things are easy to access but can quickly be erased.

#### Interview with Terence

There is no such thing as [[multi-tasking]] but you can get quite good at [[context switch]]. Though in general context switching is going to be a hurt to your productivity.

The moment when you're about to [[context switch]] can often be a big moment for [[Procrastination]]. In those times you have to be especially vigilant.

A rich environment of people and activities helps improve [[neuron generation]] in the brain.

Being in a [[creative environment]] helps to make you more [[creative]].

Don't get hung up on test questions that you can't answer when doing [[examinations]]. Skip to the ones you can easily handle first.

[[success]] isn't about being smart. It's about passion and persistence. 

#### Language learning tips

It is critical to take breaks when you're [[learning]].

If a certain learning strategy isn't working for you after a decent length of time, you need to change your [[strategy]].

Use [[mnemonics]]. Eg tish for table in German. tissues -> tish etc.

#### Creativity and problem solving

[[Solving problems]] is a [[creative]] process.

[[Leadership]] is the ability to disguise panic.

[[Discomfort]] is the sign of [[change]] occurring.

OCEAN abbreviation for characteristics:

Oppenness -> correlated with creativity
conscientousness
extraversion
agreeableness -> negatively correlated with creativity.
neuroticism

This means that being less agreeable is an important aspect of [[creative]] people. Probably because you need to disagree in order to have an original idea.

One must balance [[novelty]] with [[usefulness]] to others.

It helps a lot, when dealing with a problem, to zoom in and out to get a different [[perspective]]
### chunking
[[understanding]] is like a glue that helps you connect the information required to make chunks.

It's important to [[review]] information even if you understood it well in the moment.

The only way to achieve [[true mastery]] of a subject is to [[do it yourself]].

You need both a [[top down]] picture to get [[context]].

And you need a [[bottom up]] approach in order to develop [[chunks]] of the subject.

Both are necessary. [[Context]] for knowing when to apply a [[chunk]], and [[bottom up]] to build the chunks.

It can be a mistake to obsess over trying to fully [[understand]] a concept before moving on. Often you need to move on and allow that concept to sink in later.

#### Illusions of competence

Covered here:

* [[Recall]]
* [[Illusions of competence]]
* [[mini testing]]
* [[making mistakes]]

[[recall]] can be a great way to test your understanding. Look away for a few seconds and see if you can recall the material and the most important points.

Students who used recall as their primary learning strategy outperformed learners using any other strategy. This means [[recall]] might be the most effective way to study.

Read -> recall -> read -> recall

Recall doesn't just help you remember the material, you also gain a deeper [[understand]] of it when you bring it up in your mind.

Looking at the material and thinking that you [[understand]] it can be an [[illusion of competence]]. This illusion can be dispelled by seeing if you can recall it and [[understand]] when not looking at it.

Having the book open or googling something and then feeling like you [[understand]] it can be one of the greatest illusions of competence. As a [[programmer]] this is something to be particularly wary of.

Try to [[practice]] [[recall]] in many different places. This will give you greater [[flexibility]] in your chunks.

#### What motivates you?
Brain chemicals. neuro receptors.

[[Acetocholyne]] -> released when [[focusing]]

[[dopamine]] -> released when receiving an unexpected reward.

[[serotonin]] -> In primate communities, alpha males tend to have the most [[serotonin]], while lower ranked primates tend to have less in order of their rank.

#### The value of a chunk library
Your [[expertise]] in a subject is strongly correlated with the number of chunks you have in that subject. These chunks can be drawn upon to help you [[solve problems]].

Your [[diffuse mode]] of [[thinking]] can help you to connect [[chunks]] together. 

You'll be able to [[solve problems]] faster as new [[patterns]] form in your network of [[chunks]].

When your [[intuition]] comes to you with an answer to a [[problem]], you should still be careful and might need to check it for accuracy if it's a delicate problem.

Having a large library of chunks is also useful because often a chunk will apply in a new domain that you're learning about as well. This is called [[transfer]].
#### Einstellung, Interleaving
Be careful about trying to solve a problem using the same [[strategy]] over and over. This can be [[einstellung]].

![car stuck in a rut.](/../assets/a_000232_large.jpg)

[[Interleaving]] is when you try and [[generalise]] your understanding of a chunk by varying the context or altering the [[parameters]] of the problem. Eg doing a set of harder examples of the [[problem]]. This helps to improve [[flexibility]].

[[Book]]: The Structure of a [[scientific revolution]] New people, either young or from different fields, are normally responsible for the greatest shifts in a field. This is because they [[transfer]] their [[chunks]] from other [[contexts]].

[[einstellung]] means '[[mindset]]' in German.

### Summing up
[[Recall]] can work as a way of building hooks for your [[knowledge]].

You can [[practice]] [[Interleaving]] by working with different [[chunks]] [[approaches]] and [[techniques]] all in one session. 

Chunks are best built with:
* [[understanding]]
* [[Focused attention]]
* [[Practice]]

[[Recall]] is an effective way of testing your [[knowledge]] and [[understanding]] of something.

[[mini testing]] is an effective way to dispel [[Illusions of competence]] .

Developing a [[chunk]] does not by itself give you [[flexibility]] in [[applying]] that [[chunk]].

[[making mistakes]] is something to be welcomed when you learn.

[[Deliberate practice]] the difficult stuff. Otherwise you might fall into an [[illusion of competence]].

[[30 second review]]. This [[technique]] is a great way to cement the [[valuable information]] in your [[day to day]] life. It can be [[practiced]] by taking 30 seconds after a learning session or [[important]] [[experience]] and trying to gather up the most important things that came up. Ideally you [[write]] these down.

[[Chunking]] requires [[focused attention]] and [[understanding]]. To build [[expertise]] you need flexibility to apply your chunks in an unusual way.

[[recall]] is the best way to consolidate your [[knowledge]].

#### Interview with Dr Fortenberry

![[Fortenberry-alt-2-edited-300x224.jpg]]

[[Working]] [[alone]] is deadly. You need to do your learning as a member of some kind of community.

[[Engineering]] is a team sport. Your [[team]] members also need to be serious about [[studying]] and [[learning]].

Build a [[community]]. Give [[support]] to your community members.

When you take [[breaks]] from your [[learning]], make sure you actually [[relax]] your [[brain]].  Don't do [[stressful]] activities in your breaks.

Use as many [[modes of input]] as possible in your [[learning]]. Use sounds, visuals, vivid concepts, gamify it, [[explain]] it to others. When you convert a [[concept]] into a different form, you build new [[connections]] in your brain that help make it sick.

#### Interview with Scott Young
![[Z58FB04s_400x400.png]]

[[Scott Young]] took on and completed the learning [[challenge]] of learning a 4 year undergrad course at MIT in 1 year of [[independent learning]]. 

Always do a [[problem]] yourself before looking at the [[solution]]. Only look at the solution if you've really done your best already.

When reviewing a [[problem]], write down how you solved it. See where the [[fuzzy areas]] are in your [[recall]]. Those are your weak spots.

Try to turn your learning into [[specific]] [[projects]]. Eg [[learning]] everything about this subject in 1 month. Make it [[time bound]]. 

When you don't study with intensity you end up taking longer to learn a subject. Your learning sessions should be like short, intense sprints. 

To [[remember]] something, ask "When and how will I use this?"

#### Procrastination and memory
Good [[learning]] is a piece by piece activity. It should span a decent period of [[time]].

Using willpower is expensive. You shouldn't have to use it to fight [[procrastination]]. Find ways to dodge the moments of procrastination or to remove the [[temptation]] completely.

The discomfort or [[pain]] of starting something new, normally only lasts 8 seconds or so.

![[willpower.png]]

We [[procrastinate]] to relieve [[pain]] or [[discomfort]] from doing certain activities. [[Boredom]] is [[uncomfortable]], and if you observe carefully in your body you can feel the uncomfortable sensations when working. 

Your habits consist of 4 parts:

* The [[cue]], which is whatever triggers the [[habit]]
* The [[routine]]. This is the [[zombie]] mode where your [[brain]] falls into a state of lower [[energy]] usage and follows a familiar [[pattern]].
* The reward. This is a certain [[sensation]] you get to indicate the end of the [[habit cycle]]. Eg the feeling of clean teeth after brushing.
* The underlying [[belief]]. This is the belief that drives the habit. eg, brushing my teeth is good for me.

#### To avoid procrastination
Avoid focusing on [[product]] or outcomes. Instead, focus on the [[process]] to get the outcome. For example, instead of focusing on finishing an essay, [[focus]] on doing a 30 minute [[pomodoro]] session on the essay.

Cultivate that [[process]] as a habit. Make that process into the [[lever]] that you pull when you want to [[get something done]].

When you find yourself [[procrastinating]], simply carefully observe the [[sensations]] in your body. Often the procrastinating activity will involve something that creates [[pleasant sensations]]. Observe them. 

#### Harnessing your zombies
Analyse your habits based on their 4 parts.

##### Part 1: The cue
Each of these can be a potential cue for [[habit]] execution.
* Location. Eg, at your desk.
* Time. Eg, first thing in the morning
* Feeling. Eg, Tired, angry, or stressed.
* [[Reaction]] to stimulus. Eg, Seeing a certain image, song or person.

In my [[experience]], all of these [[stimulate]] certain [[sensations]] on the body. These sensations are what lead to a [[reaction]], which is the beginning of the [[routine]] part of the habit. 

##### The routine
The [[routine]] is where stuff happens. Often this part of a habit can be changed, while keeping the other parts. For example some smokers quit by doing a run when they feel that urge to smoke. 

Plan what you'll do instead to get the kind of [[results]] you want.

##### The reward
[[Reward]] yourself for the [[completion]] of a positive routine. This helps to cement the [[habit]] in place.

##### The belief
A great way to shift your underlying beliefs that keep you doing a certain habit can be hanging around people who have different beliefs. 

We might be [[inspired]] because of the [[results]] they get, or we might want to fit in, or it might just provide [[good company]]. The result is that our [[beliefs]] shift, and so do our [[habits]].

It's also easy to fall back into old habits during times of [[stress]]. During these times it is best to try and speak to people with the beliefs and habits we want, or change our [[context]] to make those [[undesirable habits]] more difficult to do.

#### Planning
Have a weekly list of key tasks to [[accomplish]]. These can be social, admin, personal or work related. 

Prepare a list of tasks to get done each night for the next day. This helps your [[zombie]] mode get started.

Try to keep the [[daily task list]] short, only 4 to 6 items. 

Plan the time at which you [[quit]]. Quitting your planning time is at least as important as planning your working time.

Plan when you'll take [[breaks]], and be sure to include some movement/[[exercise]].

Put the hardest stuff at the beginning of your day. ([[Eat the frog]])

### Summing up procrastination
Keep a proper [[journal]] to see what does and doesn't work. 

Delay rewards until your work is complete.

[[Trust]] your plan.

Write your tasks for the next day the day before.

Eat your frogs first.

Analyse your habits and see how to change them.

### Memory and [[mind palaces]]
Our visual and spatial abilities are highly developed compared to our brain's other abilities.

We can take advantage of this when we remember stuff by tying it up with visual and spatial features. This is the power of the [[mind palace]].

To remember something:
* It must be [[memorable]].
* It must be [[repeated]] (Anki is a great tool for this)
* You have to pay [[attention]].

The process of remembering stuff can be thought of as a cycle between our active [[working memories]] and our inactive [[long term memories]].

Every time we re-activate some [[information]] and move it to our [[working memory]] we reconsolidate that information, and make it easier to access from our [[long term memory]].

Astrocytes are a key component in brain function and learning. Here are some of their features:

* They provide nutrients to neurons.
* They play a role in the repair of neurons.
* Einstein had significantly more of these in his brain than normal. 
* Provide extracellular(outside of the cell) ion balance in the brain.

### Meaningful groups
Create [[meaningful]] groups of [[information]] to help you [[remember]] them.

Eg Vampires are repelled by Garlic, Rosemary, Hawthorne, and Mustard. GRHM -> Graham cracker. 
![[images.jpeg]]

Medical students use the sentence "Some lovers try positions they can't handle" to [[remember]] the first letters of all the bones in the hand.

Try to use this technique yourself to create novel groups. 

A memory palace is also an effective way to [[remember]] sequences of [[information]]. 

The memory palace involves breaking a location you know well into pieces and then associating each item on the list with each piece of the location in a vivid way. 

Remembering things in this way helps you to achieve mastery in them faster. It also helps you to become more creative, as these require creative images of the information to make it more vivid and [[memorable]]. 

Using these techniques does get easier over time. 

You will also be able to use and apply the concepts you've learned more easily when you can remember them easily.

### Summary
To get [[information]] into [[long term memory]] you need to consolidate it over a few days.

When you've [[learned]] a [[concept]] well it takes up less space in [[working memory]] due to [[Chunking]].

Relate [[ideas]] to things that [[interest]] you. Eg when trying to remember a specific number, think of a number in a field you like already. For example 1105 might be a significant date you need to [[remember]] in history, and for a runner this might be a good time in which to run 2km, so they can link these things together to [[remember]] the date.

By [[learning]] things quickly and well with tools like [[memory palaces]], you can quickly achieve [[mastery]].

Create [[meaningful]] groups to simplify material.

### Interview with Nelson Dellis
When trying to [[remember]] a new person, take time to find something [[interesting]] about them and create that into a vivid [[image]] of them to [[remember]] them with. 

Try to test your [[recall]] frequently.

How to remember complex concepts:
* Go through a body of text or other learning material.
* Identify key words or phrases. 
* Turn those into images.
* Put them into a memory palace.

How to keep your memory sharp:
* [[Challenge]] yourself to remember things.
* Be social.
* Have fish oil. Ideally from a cold chain source.
* Be physically active.
* Be joyful.

### Interview with Robert Gamache
![[Gamache-Robert-800-opt_tcm18-255306.jpg]]
This interview was [[particularly good]].

[[Study]] every subject [[every day]]. If you spend just 15 minutes reviewing your knowledge of all of the important subjects, you'll have a wonderful ability to work with them in your [[daily life]].

It's like [[playing an instrument]]. When you're in practice you can easily pick it up and play. When you let the [[practice]] decay for a long term it's much harder to play well coming back to it.

You can hardwire your brain to [[solve problems]] by working with [[problems]] every day. 

A great source of varied and novel problems are maths olympiads.
