### chunking
[[understanding]] is like a glue that helps you connect the information required to make chunks.

It's important to [[review]] information even if you understood it well in the moment.

The only way to achieve [[true mastery]] of a subject is to [[do it yourself]].

You need both a [[top down]] picture to get [[context]].

And you need a [[bottom up]] approach in order to develop [[chunks]] of the subject.

Both are necessary. [[Context]] for knowing when to apply a [[chunk]], and [[bottom up]] to build the chunks.

It can be a mistake to obsess over trying to fully [[understand]] a concept before moving on. Often you need to move on and allow that concept to sink in later.

#### Illusions of competence

Covered here:

* [[Recall]]
* [[Illusions of competence]]
* [[mini testing]]
* [[making mistakes]]

[[recall]] can be a great way to test your understanding. Look away for a few seconds and see if you can recall the material and the most important points.

Students who used recall as their primary learning strategy outperformed learners using any other strategy. This means [[recall]] might be the most effective way to study.

Read -> recall -> read -> recall

Recall doesn't just help you remember the material, you also gain a deeper [[understand]] of it when you bring it up in your mind.

Looking at the material and thinking that you [[understand]] it can be an [[illusion of competence]]. This illusion can be dispelled by seeing if you can recall it and [[understand]] when not looking at it.

Having the book open or googling something and then feeling like you [[understand]] it can be one of the greatest illusions of competence. As a [[programmer]] this is something to be particularly wary of.

Try to [[practice]] [[recall]] in many different places. This will give you greater [[flexibility]] in your chunks.

#### What motivates you?
Brain chemicals. neuro receptors.

[[Acetocholyne]] -> released when [[focusing]]

[[dopamine]] -> released when receiving an unexpected reward.

[[serotonin]] -> In primate communities, alpha males tend to have the most [[serotonin]], while lower ranked primates tend to have less in order of their rank.

#### The value of a chunk library
Your [[expertise]] in a subject is strongly correlated with the number of chunks you have in that subject. These chunks can be drawn upon to help you [[solve problems]].

Your [[diffuse mode]] of [[thinking]] can help you to connect [[chunks]] together. 

You'll be able to [[solve problems]] faster as new [[patterns]] form in your network of [[chunks]].

When your [[intuition]] comes to you with an answer to a [[problem]], you should still be careful and might need to check it for accuracy if it's a delicate problem.

Having a large library of chunks is also useful because often a chunk will apply in a new domain that you're learning about as well. This is called [[transfer]].
#### Einstellung, Interleaving
Be careful about trying to solve a problem using the same [[strategy]] over and over. This can be [[einstellung]].

![[a_000232_large 1.jpg]]

[[Interleaving]] is when you try and [[generalise]] your understanding of a chunk by varying the context or altering the [[parameters]] of the problem. Eg doing a set of harder examples of the [[problem]]. This helps to improve [[flexibility]].

[[Book]]: The Structure of a [[scientific revolution]] New people, either young or from different fields, are normally responsible for the greatest shifts in a field. This is because they [[transfer]] their [[chunks]] from other [[contexts]].

[[einstellung]] means '[[mindset]]' in German.

### Summing up
[[Recall]] can work as a way of building hooks for your [[knowledge]].

You can [[practice]] [[Interleaving]] by working with different [[chunks]] [[approaches]] and [[techniques]] all in one session. 

Chunks are best built with:
* [[understanding]]
* [[Focused attention]]
* [[Practice]]

[[Recall]] is an effective way of testing your [[knowledge]] and [[understanding]] of something.

[[mini testing]] is an effective way to dispel [[Illusions of competence]] .

Developing a [[chunk]] does not by itself give you [[flexibility]] in [[applying]] that [[chunk]].

[[making mistakes]] is something to be welcomed when you learn.

[[Deliberate practice]] the difficult stuff. Otherwise you might fall into an [[illusion of competence]].

[[30 second review]]. This [[technique]] is a great way to cement the [[valuable information]] in your [[day to day]] life. It can be [[practiced]] by taking 30 seconds after a learning session or [[important]] [[experience]] and trying to gather up the most important things that came up. Ideally you [[write]] these down.

[[Chunking]] requires [[focused attention]] and [[understanding]]. To build [[expertise]] you need flexibility to apply your chunks in an unusual way.

[[recall]] is the best way to consolidate your [[knowledge]].

#### Interview with Dr Fortenberry

![[Fortenberry-alt-2-edited-300x224.jpg]]

[[Working]] [[alone]] is deadly. You need to do your learning as a member of some kind of community.

[[Engineering]] is a team sport. Your [[team]] members also need to be serious about [[studying]] and [[learning]].

Build a [[community]]. Give [[support]] to your community members.

When you take [[breaks]] from your [[learning]], make sure you actually [[relax]] your [[brain]].  Don't do [[stressful]] activities in your breaks.

Use as many [[modes of input]] as possible in your [[learning]]. Use sounds, visuals, vivid concepts, gamify it, [[explain]] it to others. When you convert a [[concept]] into a different form, you build new [[connections]] in your brain that help make it sick.

#### Interview with Scott Young
![[Z58FB04s_400x400.png]]

[[Scott Young]] took on and completed the learning [[challenge]] of learning a 4 year undergrad course at MIT in 1 year of [[independent learning]]. 

Always do a [[problem]] yourself before looking at the [[solution]]. Only look at the solution if you've really done your best already.

When reviewing a [[problem]], write down how you solved it. See where the [[fuzzy areas]] are in your [[recall]]. Those are your weak spots.

Try to turn your learning into [[specific]] [[projects]]. Eg [[learning]] everything about this subject in 1 month. Make it [[time bound]]. 

When you don't study with intensity you end up taking longer to learn a subject. Your learning sessions should be like short, intense sprints. 

To [[remember]] something, ask "When and how will I use this?"
