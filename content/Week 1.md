### Focused and diffuse mode
[[Focused mode]] is a mode of [[attention]] where we [[intentionally]] direct all our [[working memory]] and [[cognitive power]] on a single [[problem]]. This involves a [[deliberate practice ]]of holding certain parts of the problem in mind. 

[[Diffuse mode]] is when we relax our [[attention]] and let our mind move easily between different ideas. 

These two modes can be thought of as the way a pinball moves around a machine. When the pins on the machine are very close together it stays in a small area.

When the pins are further apart the ball can bounce all over the machine. This means that [[novel connections]] can be made.

Both are important for [[learning]], and we need to be able to swap between them to [[solve problems]] and have [[new ideas]].

[[Dreams]] can be an amazing place for distant [[neural connections]] to spark. But for dreams to work you need to have wrestled with the [[problem]] consciously and have the [[information]] in your [[mind]] during the day.

[[Practice]] makes permanent

Remove all [[distractions]] when in a focused [[pomodoro]] session


Your [[neural connections]] or patterns get stronger with [[repeated exercise]]

To build strong [[neural connections]] you need to [[Practice]] them each day over a [[longer period]].

#### Intro to memory

[[analogy]] is a useful tool for learning as it makes things more [[memorable]].

[[long term memory]] can be compared to a storehouse where you can store an incredible amount of [[data]] but where that [[data]] is difficult or slow to access.

[[working memory]] acts as a blackboard where things are easy to access but can quickly be erased.

#### Interview with Terence

There is no such thing as [[multi-tasking]] but you can get quite good at [[context switch]]. Though in general context switching is going to be a hurt to your productivity.

The moment when you're about to [[context switch]] can often be a big moment for [[Procrastination]]. In those times you have to be especially vigilant.

A rich environment of people and activities helps improve [[neuron generation]] in the brain.

Being in a [[creative environment]] helps to make you more [[creative]].

Don't get hung up on test questions that you can't answer when doing [[examinations]]. Skip to the ones you can easily handle first.

[[success]] isn't about being smart. It's about passion and persistence. 

#### Language learning tips

It is critical to take breaks when you're [[learning]].

If a certain learning strategy isn't working for you after a decent length of time, you need to change your [[strategy]].

Use [[mnemonics]]. Eg tish for table in German. tissues -> tish etc.

#### Creativity and problem solving

[[Solving problems]] is a [[creative]] process.

[[Leadership]] is the ability to disguise panic.

[[Discomfort]] is the sign of [[change]] occurring.

OCEAN abbreviation for characteristics:

Oppenness -> correlated with creativity
conscientousness
extraversion
agreeableness -> negatively correlated with creativity.
neuroticism

This means that being less agreeable is an important aspect of [[creative]] people. Probably because you need to disagree in order to have an original idea.

One must balance [[novelty]] with [[usefulness]] to others.

It helps a lot, when dealing with a problem, to zoom in and out to get a different [[perspective]]
