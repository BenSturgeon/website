#### Procrastination and memory
Good [[learning]] is a piece by piece activity. It should span a decent period of [[time]].

Using willpower is expensive. You shouldn't have to use it to fight [[procrastination]]. Find ways to dodge the moments of procrastination or to remove the [[temptation]] completely.

The discomfort or [[pain]] of starting something new, normally only lasts 8 seconds or so.

![[willpower.png]]

We [[procrastinate]] to relieve [[pain]] or [[discomfort]] from doing certain activities. [[Boredom]] is [[uncomfortable]], and if you observe carefully in your body you can feel the uncomfortable sensations when working. 

Your habits consist of 4 parts:

* The [[cue]], which is whatever triggers the [[habit]]
* The [[routine]]. This is the [[zombie]] mode where your [[brain]] falls into a state of lower [[energy]] usage and follows a familiar [[pattern]].
* The reward. This is a certain [[sensation]] you get to indicate the end of the [[habit cycle]]. Eg the feeling of clean teeth after brushing.
* The underlying [[belief]]. This is the belief that drives the habit. eg, brushing my teeth is good for me.

#### To avoid procrastination
Avoid focusing on [[product]] or outcomes. Instead, focus on the [[process]] to get the outcome. For example, instead of focusing on finishing an essay, [[focus]] on doing a 30 minute [[pomodoro]] session on the essay.

Cultivate that [[process]] as a habit. Make that process into the [[lever]] that you pull when you want to [[get something done]].

When you find yourself [[procrastinating]], simply carefully observe the [[sensations]] in your body. Often the procrastinating activity will involve something that creates [[pleasant sensations]]. Observe them. 

#### Harnessing your zombies
Analyse your habits based on their 4 parts.

##### Part 1: The cue
Each of these can be a potential cue for [[habit]] execution.
* Location. Eg, at your desk.
* Time. Eg, first thing in the morning
* Feeling. Eg, Tired, angry, or stressed.
* [[Reaction]] to stimulus. Eg, Seeing a certain image, song or person.

In my [[experience]], all of these [[stimulate]] certain [[sensations]] on the body. These sensations are what lead to a [[reaction]], which is the beginning of the [[routine]] part of the habit. 

##### The routine
The [[routine]] is where stuff happens. Often this part of a habit can be changed, while keeping the other parts. For example some smokers quit by doing a run when they feel that urge to smoke. 

Plan what you'll do instead to get the kind of [[results]] you want.

##### The reward
[[Reward]] yourself for the [[completion]] of a positive routine. This helps to cement the [[habit]] in place.

##### The belief
A great way to shift your underlying beliefs that keep you doing a certain habit can be hanging around people who have different beliefs. 

We might be [[inspired]] because of the [[results]] they get, or we might want to fit in, or it might just provide [[good company]]. The result is that our [[beliefs]] shift, and so do our [[habits]].

It's also easy to fall back into old habits during times of [[stress]]. During these times it is best to try and speak to people with the beliefs and habits we want, or change our [[context]] to make those [[undesirable habits]] more difficult to do.

#### Planning
Have a weekly list of key tasks to [[accomplish]]. These can be social, admin, personal or work related. 

Prepare a list of tasks to get done each night for the next day. This helps your [[zombie]] mode get started.

Try to keep the [[daily task list]] short, only 4 to 6 items. 

Plan the time at which you [[quit]]. Quitting your planning time is at least as important as planning your working time.

Plan when you'll take [[breaks]], and be sure to include some movement/[[exercise]].

Put the hardest stuff at the beginning of your day. ([[Eat the frog]])

### Summing up procrastination
Keep a proper [[journal]] to see what does and doesn't work. 

Delay rewards until your work is complete.

[[Trust]] your plan.

Write your tasks for the next day the day before.

Eat your frogs first.

Analyse your habits and see how to change them.

### Memory and [[mind palaces]]
Our visual and spatial abilities are highly developed compared to our brain's other abilities.

We can take advantage of this when we remember stuff by tying it up with visual and spatial features. This is the power of the [[mind palace]].

To remember something:
* It must be [[memorable]].
* It must be [[repeated]] (Anki is a great tool for this)
* You have to pay [[attention]].

The process of remembering stuff can be thought of as a cycle between our active [[working memories]] and our inactive [[long term memories]].

Every time we re-activate some [[information]] and move it to our [[working memory]] we reconsolidate that information, and make it easier to access from our [[long term memory]].

Astrocytes are a key component in brain function and learning. Here are some of their features:

* They provide nutrients to neurons.
* They play a role in the repair of neurons.
* Einstein had significantly more of these in his brain than normal. 
* Provide extracellular(outside of the cell) ion balance in the brain.

### Meaningful groups
Create [[meaningful]] groups of [[information]] to help you [[remember]] them.

Eg Vampires are repelled by Garlic, Rosemary, Hawthorne, and Mustard. GRHM -> Graham cracker.

Medical students use the sentence "Some lovers try positions they can't handle" to [[remember]] the first letters of all the bones in the hand.

Try to use this technique yourself to create novel groups. 

A memory palace is also an effective way to [[remember]] sequences of [[information]]. 

The memory palace involves breaking a location you know well into pieces and then associating each item on the list with each piece of the location in a vivid way. 

Remembering things in this way helps you to achieve mastery in them faster. It also helps you to become more creative, as these require creative images of the information to make it more vivid and [[memorable]]. 

Using these techniques does get easier over time. 

You will also be able to use and apply the concepts you've learned more easily when you can remember them easily.

### Summary
To get [[information]] into [[long term memory]] you need to consolidate it over a few days.

When you've [[learned]] a [[concept]] well it takes up less space in [[working memory]] due to [[Chunking]].

Relate [[ideas]] to things that [[interest]] you. Eg when trying to remember a specific number, think of a number in a field you like already. For example 1105 might be a significant date you need to [[remember]] in history, and for a runner this might be a good time in which to run 2km, so they can link these things together to [[remember]] the date.

By [[learning]] things quickly and well with tools like [[memory palaces]], you can quickly achieve [[mastery]].

Create [[meaningful]] groups to simplify material.

### Interview with Nelson Dellis
When trying to [[remember]] a new person, take time to find something [[interesting]] about them and create that into a vivid [[image]] of them to [[remember]] them with. 

Try to test your [[recall]] frequently.

How to remember complex concepts:
* Go through a body of text or other learning material.
* Identify key words or phrases. 
* Turn those into images.
* Put them into a memory palace.

How to keep your memory sharp:
* [[Challenge]] yourself to remember things.
* Be social.
* Have fish oil. Ideally from a cold chain source.
* Be physically active.
* Be joyful.

### Interview with Robert Gamache
![[Gamache-Robert-800-opt_tcm18-255306.jpg]]
This interview was [[particularly good]].

[[Study]] every subject [[every day]]. If you spend just 15 minutes reviewing your knowledge of all of the important subjects, you'll have a wonderful ability to work with them in your [[daily life]].

It's like [[playing an instrument]]. When you're in practice you can easily pick it up and play. When you let the [[practice]] decay for a long term it's much harder to play well coming back to it.

You can hardwire your brain to [[solve problems]] by working with [[problems]] every day. 

A great source of varied and novel problems are maths olympiads.
