# About me 

I am currently a 26 year old South African, living in Cape Town.

I am passionate about philsophy, AI, self-development, reading, writing, and spiritual development. 

# Philosophies
Recently I have also become a big proponent of effective altruism, as I find it aligns with many of my deeply held values. I would like to contribute to the dream of establishing of an effective altruism hub here in Cape Town where maybe in future we can have a co-working space and EA house to share ideas and help to build effective altruism on the African continent.

I also am a huge fan of Stoicism. Its ideas about self-mastery, equanimity, and doing what is right are hugely inspiring to me. Ryan Holiday is a huge influence, but the book that I think most clearly captures the main ideas of stoicism is a Guide to The Good Life. 

Taoism is also one philosophy that I have to mention. Taoism (or Daoism) seem to capture a deep truth about the world. I know that whatever happens there is a peace in the zen that lies in the stillness and fullness of the tao. My favourite texts in this space are the Zhuangze (chapters 1 to 7) and the Tao Te Ching (ideally the most unabridged version you can find).

# AI alignment
My key target in life is to contribute towards the solving of the alignment problem, and to that end I have become a machine learning engineer and enthusiast of all things AI. 

I love software development generally and all the things that it makes possible but the incredible potential of AI has made a deep impression on me, and I think we are living in a critical time period in human history where the choices we make around the development of AI will have a profound impact on the future.

# Meditation
The spiritual aspect of my life became significant in the year of 2019 when I read a book called Awareness by Anthony de Mello which became a wonderful framework for understanding a lot of concepts that really exist to me as an operating system for a deep and honest understanding of the whole separate to the layers that I had built on top of my perceptions of the world. 

I followed this up with a 10 day meditation course at Dhamma Pataka in Worcester and since have been back multiple times and plan to continue doing so in the future. The experience had a world-shattering impact on me and I believe that in following that practice I have taken steps to actually remove those layers on my perception which I had previously discovered.

# ADD
My brain seems to be an ADD brain, and I have struggled with this condition since I was young. There is always contraversy around this term but I have been diagnosed by many professionals with ADD and thus I take it seriously. Many of the deepest struggles that I face in my day to day life come back to my being ADD, especially around motivation and being able to focus and do difficult tasks that I put before myself. 

A huge part of my self development journey as well as my meditation journey have been about trying to soothe the symptoms of the ADD. I have found that unless I take it seriously and create an environment which supports me then my life becomes very difficult.

# Reading and Writing
I am a passionate reader and writer. My first series which I remember being my favourite for a long time was the His Dark Materials trilogy. My love of fantasy and sci-fi stories was and still is an unquenchable fire. 

I have since spread out and now I read from a broad spectrum, especially in the self-development, maths/science and spiritual spheres. But everything which isn't speculative fiction is still some effort to read, while I am always utterly consumed by good speculative fiction.

Now I am trying to give back to the genre by polishing my writing skills and putting together the pieces for a first novel.
