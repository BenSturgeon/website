# About me 

This page is a long description of me, and is somewhat autobiographical in nature. I hope to convey both the raw facts and some of the important ideas which have shaped me over the years.

I studied computer science and philosophy, and spent 5 years studying them at university. I then pivoted into AI after becoming incredibly inspired from reading the book Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark. I decided that AI was the most important problem of our time and that I was in a good position to contribute towards solving the problem of AGI. I am currently unsure of what exactly that will look like, but I believe in a lot of the ideas espoused by the Effective Altruism movement, and have been trying to get more of the skills required to work in AI safety. For me, these involve software engineering, machine learning, deep learning, as well as writing and research. 

Currently I work at Cape AI, which is an AI consulting firm based in Cape Town. It's a very pleasant place to work, with fantastic people, and lots of interesting problems to be exposed to. I feel very fortunate to be able to do the kind of work that I do.

I am a strong believer in self-development and self-education. In line with this belief I chose to pursue a self-study approach to AI in my career rather than to continue down a research path at university. I experienced the effectiveness with which it is possible to self-teach while I was working as an intern and decided that a lot of the curriculum at university seemed to cover stuff I was familiar with already, and came with the cost of tuition and following class schedules. 

I have spent most of my life in South Africa. I was born at home in Parkhurst Johannesburg (I think) and spent my early years growing on a farm in Lanseria. As I got larger my parents decided to grow me in the city of Johannesburg itself. Eventually they separated, and each individually moved to Cape Town where I would spend my teenage years. 

Those teenage years were spent at an interesting school called Cedar House, which took a broader view than most of what a school should look like, and which gave a lot of freedom and autonomy to its students. By my estimation, it was a very good education. I moved on from there to Rhodes University. The people there were very unique and quite divergent thinkers. It's difficult to describe exactly what sets them apart, but in general I found them very friendly, wholesome, and a little bit whimsical. The education was decent, and the town and the feeling of being in an isolated community led to some really fun years playing a lot of Dungeons and Dragons.

For a long time I played video games, or distracted myself on the internet instead of pursuing things which I felt I really needed to be doing. I've made many changes in recent years to how I approach pleasure and entertainment, as I found pursuing pleasure for its own sake was ultimately totally unsatisfying. Somehow, I still enjoy everything that I do a lot, but normally those activities are not centrered purely around pleasure, but scratch some other, deeper itch.

 I experienced a massive shift in 2019 when I gained new mentors such as Tim Ferris, Derek Sivers, and read books like Awareness by Anthony De Mello, which gave me a better framework for understanding spirituality. It shifted my thinking from trying to numb the unpleasant sensations and constantly try to experience positive ones, but rather to look beyond the structures of living that had held me for so long. I began to realise that happiness was a state of mind that I was responsible for creating. That my interpretation of what happened around me determined my response. That I could be master of my own mind.
 

At the beginning of 2020 I began a serious vipassana meditation practice following a 10 day course with S.N Goenka. I now work hard to maintain a strong daily practice. I don't think I could trust myself to be a good human without that practice to ground me in my life. Meditation helps to not cause harm in the world and it makes it easier and more natural to want to serve others. 

I love code, computers, technology, and AI. Currently I am working on technical alignment research and I am dedicating my career towards AI safety generally. I am not necessarily terrified of inevitable extinction from AGI, but I do think that the chances are uncomfortably high that if we build an AGI it will have catastrophic consequences, and I think we might stumble into that technology much faster than we expect. 

I am a huge fan of stoicism. From Marcus Aurelius, to Ryan Holiday, to Seneca. There's something incredibly satisfying about absording these ancient ideas and applying them in life. It's a really powerful operating system in general.

Brazilian jiu jitsu has also had a huge impact on me. It's so fun and strange and ego smashing, it feels like it's making me wiser. 

I will be updating this page as time goes by, and hope that it has given some insight and maybe even some entertainment. 

This website's format is largely based on [Derek Siver's website](https://sive.rs/). He's such an inspiration to me, and shifted the course of my life through his book recommendations and thinking.
