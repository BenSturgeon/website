# About me 

I am currently a 27 year old South African, living in Cape Town.

I am passionate about philsophy, AI, self-development, reading, writing, and spiritual development. 

# Philosophies
I am a huge fan of stoicism. From Marcus Aurelius, to Ryan Holiday, to Seneca. There's something incredibly satisfying about absording these ancient ideas and applying them in life. It's a really powerful operating system in general.

Recently I have also become a big proponent of effective altruism, as I find it aligns with many of my deeply held values. I would like to contribute to the dream of establishing of an effective altruism hub here in Cape Town where maybe in future we can have a co-working space and EA house to share ideas and help to build effective altruism on the African continent.

Taoism is also one philosophy that I have to mention. Taoism (or Daoism) seem to capture a deep truth about the world. I know that whatever happens there is a peace in the zen that lies in the stillness and fullness of the tao. My favourite texts in this space are the Zhuangze (chapters 1 to 7) and the Tao Te Ching (ideally the most unabridged version you can find).

I love a lot of what is contained in the essence of the Buddha's teachings, though I don't call myself buddhist. There is a rich tradition of writing and ideas in the Buddhist tradition however, and I connect very strongly with the ideas of how to conduct oneself and the fundamental world view of the Buddha which is that through delusion we become unable to make clear sense of our reality.

I love rationality, scientific thinking, mathematics, art, music, good design, and being in nature.

# Biographical info

My teenage years were spent at an interesting school called Cedar House, which took a broader view than most of what a school should look like, and which gave a lot of freedom and autonomy to its students. By my estimation, it was a very good education. I moved on from there to Rhodes University. The people there were very unique and quite divergent thinkers. It's difficult to describe exactly what sets them apart, but in general I found them very friendly, wholesome, and a little bit whimsical. The education was decent, and the town and the feeling of being in an isolated community led to some really fun years playing a lot of Dungeons and Dragons.

For a long time I played video games, or distracted myself on the internet instead of pursuing things which I felt I really needed to be doing. I've made many changes in recent years to how I approach pleasure and entertainment, as I found pursuing pleasure for its own sake was ultimately totally unsatisfying. Somehow, I still enjoy everything that I do, but those activities are not centrered purely around pleasure, but scratch some other, deeper itch.

# Meditation

 I experienced a massive shift in 2019 when I gained new mentors such as Tim Ferris, Derek Sivers, and read books like Awareness by Anthony De Mello, which gave me a better framework for understanding spirituality. It shifted my thinking from trying to numb the unpleasant sensations and constantly try to experience positive ones, but rather to look beyond the structures of living that had held me for so long. I began to realise that happiness was a state of mind that I was responsible for creating. That my interpretation of what happened around me determined my response. I realised the possibility of mastering my own mind.
 

At the beginning of 2020 I began a serious vipassana meditation practice following a 10 day course with S.N Goenka. I now work hard to maintain a strong daily practice. I don't think I could trust myself to be a good human without that practice to ground me in my life. Meditation helps to not cause harm in the world and it makes it easier and more natural to want to serve others. 

A huge part of my self development journey as well as my meditation journey have been about trying to soothe the symptoms of the ADD. I have found that unless I take it seriously and create an environment which supports me then my life becomes very difficult.

# What I'm working on
I love code, computers, technology, and AI. Currently I am working on technical alignment research and I am dedicating my career towards AI safety generally. I am not necessarily terrified of inevitable extinction from AGI, but I do think that the chances are uncomfortably high that if we build an AGI it will have catastrophic consequences, and I think we might stumble into that technology much faster than we expect. 

My current work aims to focus on instilling moral values into RL agents, and trying to make RL agents more interpretable through techniques developed in the natural language processing domain. I am also very interested in developing evaluations for testing alignment in large language models.

# Reading and Writing
I am a passionate reader and nascent writer. My first series which I remember being my favourite for a long time was the His Dark Materials trilogy. My love of fantasy and sci-fi stories was and still is an unquenchable fire. 

I have since spread out and now I read from a broad spectrum, but I find it easiest to get obsessively stuck to reading fantasy and sci-fi.
