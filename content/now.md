Currently I am based in Cape Town South Africa. 

I recently started a company focusing on evaluations for frontier AI models, specifically looking at aspects of agency and possible harms on human agency from these models. The name of the company is Telos Research and we plan to expand our evaluations work into an official service. We also do field building activities under the name AI Safety Cape Town.

I am working on a master's degree as part of [Shocklab](https://shocklab.net/supervising/), with Jonathan Shock as my supervisor. The current focus of my work is doing mechanistic interpretability to better understand how RL policy agents work. The specific model we're looking at is trained to solve mazes that require it to find multiple keys. It's a tricky network, but we're learning a lot!

I recently got accepted into [ARENA](https://www.arena.education/), which I am very excited about. I will be travelling to London for the month of September to take part in that. After that I'll be staying at [CEELAR](https://www.ceealar.org/) for most of October and then traveling to America EAG Boston at the beginning of November. 

I am currently trying to relocate myself either to the UK or US, so if you know any good ways to do this, please let me know!
