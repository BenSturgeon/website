Currently I am based in Cape Town South Africa. 

I recently started a company focusing on evaluations for frontier AI models, specifically looking at aspects of agency and possible harms on human agency from these models. The name of the company is Telos Research and we plan to expand our evaluations work into an official service. We also do field building activities under the name AI Safety Cape Town.

I am working on a master's degree as part of [Shocklab](https://shocklab.net/supervising/), with Jonathan Shock as my supervisor. The current focus of my work is doing mechanistic interpretability to better understand how RL policy agents work. The specific model we're looking at is trained to solve mazes that require it to find multiple keys. This work will also culminate in a submission to NeurIPS, and we're quite excited about the results.

I'm also working on an LLM evaluation project called Human Agency Bench. This project focuses on developing metrics to assess how different LLMs impact human agency (either enhancing or harming it). I'm collaborating with Jacy Reese Anthis, Daniel Samuelson, and Jacob Haimes on this work, which we plan to submit to NeurIPS 2025. You can view our preliminary results [here](https://agencyevals.ath.cx:5000/).

I am currently trying to relocate myself either to the UK or US, so if you have any good opportunities for this, please let me know!
