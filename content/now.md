Currently I am based in Cape Town South Africa. 

I recently started a company focusing on evaluations for frontier AI models, specifically looking at aspects of agency and possible harms on human agency from these models. The name of the company is Telos Research and we plan to expand our evaluations work into an official service. We also do field building activities under the name AI Safety Cape Town.

I am working on a master's degree as part of [Shocklab](https://shocklab.net/supervising/), with Jonathan Shock as my supervisor. The current focus of my work is doing mechanistic interpretability to better understand how RL policy agents work. The specific model we're looking at is trained to solve mazes that require it to find multiple keys. It's a tricky network, but we're learning a lot!

I'll be attending AAAI to present a [workshop paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uewIN57VyaBjWFwPlSEUExc7IIUEhppp/view?usp=drive_link) there and before that will be stopping in at EAG bay area. I'll be around the Bay for around a week after the conference and would love to spend time connecting with as many people as I can so if you're reading this and would like to connect there please do reach out!

I am currently trying to relocate myself either to the UK or US, so if you have any good opportunities for this, please let me know!
